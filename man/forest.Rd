\usage{
forest(x, y, individualTrees = FALSE, ntree = 1000, replace = TRUE,
  var.type = NULL, B = NULL, keepForest = TRUE, mtry = if (is.factor(y))
  floor(sqrt(ncol(x))) else max(floor(ncol(x)/3), 1), nodeSize = if
  (is.factor(y)) 1 else 5, sampSize = if (replace) nrow(x) else ceiling(0.632
  * nrow(x)), maxNodes = 2 * trunc(sampSize/max(1, nodeSize - 4)) + 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{matrix of predictors. Currently non-response is not supported, and categorical predictors are converted to their numeric equivalents, not made into indicator variables. The latter feature is pending.}

\item{y}{vector of response. If it is a factor, classification is assumed. Otherwise, regression is assumed. Currently, only binary classification is supported, and non-response is not supported.}

\item{individualTrees}{whether to return predictions of individual trees, default is FALSE. If var.type is not NULL, this is set to TRUE.}

\item{ntree}{number of trees desired, default is 1000}

\item{replace}{bootstrap samples or subsamples, default is bootstrap samples. If var.type = "ustat", this is set to FALSE; if var.type = "infjack", this is set to TRUE.}

\item{var.type}{default is NULL. Type of variance estimate to be computed. 2 options: "ustat" for u-statistic based which needs replace=FALSE or "infjack" for infinitesimal jackknife which needs replace=TRUE}

\item{B}{default is NULL. Number of unique common observations for u-statistic based variance estimate. Note that L, the number of trees sharing a common observation, typically >> B.}

\item{keepForest}{output forest in output object or not, default is TRUE}

\item{mtry}{number of variables randomly sampled at each split, default value is floor(sqrt(p)) for classification, max(floor(p/3),1) for regression, where p is the number of features}

\item{nodeSize}{minimum size of terminal nodes, default value is 1 for classification, 5 for regression}

\item{sampSize}{size of sample to draw, default value is n for bootstrap samples, 0.632*n for subsamples, where n is the number of observations}

\item{maxNodes}{maximum number of terminal nodes a tree can have}
}
\value{
List with the following components
\item{forest}{forest object, NULL if keepForest=FALSE}
\item{inbag.times}{n by ntree matrix (i,j)th value being number of times observation i was used in tree j}
\item{oob.times}{number of times observation was out-of-bag}
\item{predictedAll}{only returned if individualTrees=TRUE. n by ntree matrix with (i,j)th value being tree j's prediction for observation i} 
\item{predictedOOB}{only returned if individualTrees=TRUE. predictedAll but with in-bag observations NA-ed}
\item{predictedProb}{only returned for classification and if individualTrees=TRUE. n by ntree matrix with (i,j)th value being tree j's predicted probability of observation i being of class with key value 1. See forestobject$key for mapping of key value to class} 
\item{predictedProbOOB}{only returned for classification and if individualTrees=TRUE. predictedProb but with in-bag observations NA-ed}
\item{predicted}{length n vector of predictions based on out-of-bag observations}
\item{err.rate}{only returned for classification. Forest error rate}
\item{mse}{only returned for regression. Forest mean square error}
\item{type}{classification or regression}
\item{key}{only returned for classification. Mapping of numbers to classes}
\item{varNames}{names of features}
\item{ntree}{number of trees in forest}
\item{replace}{replace value used}
\item{var.type}{var.type value used}
\item{B}{B value used}
\item{sampSize}{sampSize value used}
\item{individualTrees}{individualTrees value used}
