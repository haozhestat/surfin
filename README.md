Statistical Inference for Random Forests

This R package computes standard error estimates for random forest predictions using a fast implementation of random forests in C++. Two variance estimates are provided: U-statistic based (Mentch & Hooker, 2016) and infinitesimal jackknife (Wager, Hastie, Efron, 2014).
